**Friends Enemies Final Mix Master Request**

**Purpose**
Master the final mix "Friends & Enemies."

**Mahamantra**
The Hare Krishna mantra, also known as the Maha Mantra, is a 16-word chant that has been used for centuries to bring about peace of mind and connect with the divine.

**Project Detals**
Here are the details I'd like to request:

**Final Mix Approval:** Please review the attached final mix and confirm if any adjustments are needed to ensure it meets our standards.

**File Format:** Once the mix is approved, could you please bounce it to a WAV file? This format ensures optimal quality for the mastering process.

**Mastering Process:** During mastering, I'd like you to use EQ, saturation, compression, stereo widening, and reverb to enhance the track while maintaining its laid-back and relaxing vibe.

**Loudness Optimization:** To achieve a professional sound, please apply compression and limiting techniques to boost the overall loudness of the track while preserving its dynamics.

******Reference Track:** ****I've selected "The Light" by Common as a reference track for the relaxed atmosphere and smooth production. Please use this as a benchmark to ensure the mastered track achieves a similar vibe and sound quality.

**Project Layout:**

**Track:** Instrumental track with no vocals.
**Voice:** Singer vocals for the track.
**Picture:** Cover art image.
**Final:** MP4 file of the mastered song.
